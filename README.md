# Game
A simple game inspired by the reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/6wqi3m/smt_a_social_game_where_youre_randomly_shuffled/ and the user https://www.reddit.com/user/akaNeon1 !
The goal is simple, load a few people in a room together, and figure out who the machine is! If you guess correctly, you win a few point, if you are wrong you lose a point! Ask questions to try to figure out who the AI is! 
Also inspired by the old **and** upcoming movie BladeRunner!
